- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @caitlinnaylor
- I'm studying Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington 
- My main programming languages are Python and Java 
- Please note that VUW has restrictions on us posting assignment work, so coding seen here is out of date with my current skills - until I get some free time for personal projects.
